# Fpay Frontend Challenge
### By: Jimmy Buritic√°

For this challenge, I used the following software:

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript

## How to Setup

1. Clone GitHub repo for this project locally.
2. Update the **_fpay.js_** file with the current URL, only if it has changed.

```
const URL_GLOBAL = 'http://localhost/fpay/public/api';
```
3. Open the file **_index.html_**.
